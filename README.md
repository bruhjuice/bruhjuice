I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Southern California (USC).

I just finished my software development internship at Lawrence Livermore National Labatory, and will be a course producer for CSCI 270: Introduction to Algorithms and Theory of Computing in the upcoming semester. 

Some interests: 
I love all things music and try to expose myself to as many different new sounds as possible, and am willing to give almost any album a shot. I also really enjoy the outdoors whether that be hiking, camping, or road trips.  

Short term goals: Get AWS certified! Get better with React

I'm currently searching for internship opportunities for summer 2023. 
Feel free to contact me at maxl@usc.edu for any inqueries or just to chat!
