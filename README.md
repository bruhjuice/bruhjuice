### Hi there, I'm Max! 👋 
![total visits](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=bruhjuice.bruhjuice)

I'm currently a junior at the University of Southern California (USC) studying computer science.

I just finished my software development internship at Lawrence Livermore National Labatory, and will be a course producer for CSCI 270: Introduction to Algorithms and Theory of Computing in the upcoming semester. 

**Some interests:** 

I love all things music and try to expose myself to as many different new sounds as possible and am willing to give almost any album a shot. I also really enjoy the outdoors whether that be hiking, camping, or road trips. (my profile pic was taken at Joshua Tree National Park!) 

**Short term goals:** 

Get AWS certified! Get better with React
