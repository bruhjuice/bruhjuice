### Hi there, I'm Max! 👋 
![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=bruhjuice.bruhjuice)

I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Southern California (USC). My public GitHub is a bit outdated and full of procedural programming examples instead of OOP, as many of my recent projects are privated or in-progress. Hopefully that changes soon! 

I am a computer science god please hire me.
